I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Yonsei University, South Korea, supervised by [Prof. Byungchan Han](https://www.bchansgroup.net/). I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Yonsei University in 2023, and Bachelor of engineering in Energy and Evironmental Science and Engineering at the same institute in 2018.

<strong>Research Interests</strong>: During my Ph.D., I worked on the materials simulations to design adsorbents, solid ionic conductors, and catalysts materials using First-principles calculations, and devloped machine-learning interatomic potentials integrated with first-principles data for crystalline polymers and alloy nanoparticles. Currently, I am interested in high-throughput virtual screening of energy materials. Specifically, I focus on atomic local environments engineering to activate the site properties toward the target applications.
