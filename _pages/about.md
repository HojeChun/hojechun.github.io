I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of <b>Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</b> at Yonsei University, South Korea, supervised by [Prof. Byungchan Han](https://www.bchansgroup.net/). I obtained my Ph.D. from the <b>Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</b> at Yonsei University in 2023, and Bachelor of engineering in <b>Energy and Evironmental Science and Engineering</b> at the same institute in 2018.

<b>Research Interests</b>: During my Ph.D., I worked on the materials simulations to design adsorbents, solid ionic conductors, and catalysts materials using <b>First-principles calculations</b>, and devloped machine-learning interatomic potentials integrated with first-principles data for crystalline polymers and alloy nanoparticles. Currently, I am interested in <b>high-throughput virtual screening</b> of energy materials. Specifically, I focus on atomic local environments engineering to activate the site properties toward the target applications.
