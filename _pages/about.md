I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), under the guidance of [Prof. Rafael GÃ³mez-Bombarelli] (https://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/). Before joing the group, I worked with [Prof. Byungchan Han](https://www.bchansgroup.net/) at Yonsei University, South Korea. I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in 2023, and I completed my Bachelor of engineering in Energy and Evironmental Science and Engineering (EESE) at the same institute in 2018.

<strong>Research Interests</strong>: During my Ph.D., I worked on the materials simulations to design adsorbents, solid ionic conductors, and catalysts materials using First-principles calculations, and devloped machine-learning interatomic potentials integrated with first-principles data for crystalline polymers and alloy nanoparticles. Currently, I am interested in high-throughput virtual screening of energy materials and multi-scale atomistic simulation of epitaxial growth for semiconductors.
